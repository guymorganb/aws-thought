Deploy Amazon DynamoDB to AWS
In this step, we'll deploy DynamoDB to AWS.

We used a local DynamoDB instance for the development phase of creating the database operations. Now that we've fully integrated DynamoDB into the application, let's use the web service and create a new Thoughts table in the cloud.

Now the dynamodb service object will point to the web service and not the local instance, because we previously configured the AWS CLI to connect to the S3 web service. Because we already assigned the access key and secret key, the service object can verify account authentication.

From the root directory, execute the following commands:

node ./server/db/CreateThoughtsTable.js && node ./server/db/LoadThoughts.js

We can also perform a table scan in the AWS CLI to check whether the data is from the old table or the new table, this is useful for a quick inspection, using the following command:

aws dynamodb scan --table-name Thoughts


DynamoDB limits each item or record at 400 kB

The data response from S3 includes the bucket name and the URL of the image, which is assigned to the Location key. This is the value we'll store in the DynamoDB as a reference to this image.

Not only can S3 store images in the cloud, but it also offers a URL that enables access to the image. This is an incredibly useful feature, making the image widely available and accessible once it is stored in the cloud. We'll soon see how we can incorporate this URL into the application to render the images.
